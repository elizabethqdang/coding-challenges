# üê∫ QA Wolf Take Home Assignment

Welcome to the QA Wolf take home assignment! We appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing what you come up with.

## Instructions

In this assignment, you will create a basic test on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) using JavaScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) framework.

This assignment should take around an hour to complete.

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Create a basic [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) test that goes to [netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) and verifies that you cannot sign in with an invalid email/password combination. Add your code to the `index.js` file after the `// YOUR CODE STARTS` comment. The command `npm run test` will run your test.

3. Optional: If you want to add an assertion, you can use Playwright (example: [page.waitForSelector](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-selector) or [page.waitForFunction](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-function)).

4. Send [laura@qawolf.com](mailto:laura@qawolf.com) a link to a zip file of this folder on Google Drive.

If you send us your completed assignment by the specified due date, we will pay you $100 for your time. Thanks again for your interest in QA Wolf!
